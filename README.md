## Installation

- To run this project you need to download it and open the html file in a browser. The index.html file points to an already compiled css, that results of the scss file. So, there is no need to use a pre-processor. If you want to edit something, you can change the css file directly, or, if you want to use scss, use a live sass compiler or a pre-processor.

### Clone
